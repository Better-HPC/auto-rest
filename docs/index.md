# Auto REST

The auto-rest utility is a command-line tool for deploying dynamically generated REST APIs. 
The application automatically maps database schemas and generates API endpoints for table-level and record-level operations.
While optimized for development use, it is designed with production environments in mind and offers an efficient solution for rapid API deployment.

Application features include:

- Built-in support for common database systems (including SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server).
- Simple extensibility to additional database systems using third-party database drivers.
- Fully functional API endpoints with filtering, pagination, and ordering capabilities.
- Session-based authentication with transparent pass through to the underlying database.
