# Auto REST

AutoRest is a command line tool for deploying dynamically generated REST APIs against relational databases.
The application automatically maps existing database schemas and deploys a customized API server with per-table endpoints.

Application features include:

- Built in support for multiple database types, including SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.
- Simple extensibility to additional database systems using third-party database drivers.
- Fully functional API endpoints with filtering, pagination, and ordering capabilities.
- Session based authentication using transparent authentication against the underlying database.
- Efficient performance with scalable connection pooling and native asynchronous support.
