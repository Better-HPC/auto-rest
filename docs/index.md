# Auto REST

The `auto-rest` utility is a command line tool for automatically mapping database schemas and deploying dynamically generated REST APIs.
Designed primarily for development, but with production environments in mind, the application provides a simple method for quickly deploying 

Application features include:

- Built in support for multiple database types, including SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.
- Simple extensibility to additional database systems using third-party database drivers.
- Fully functional API endpoints with filtering, pagination, and ordering capabilities.
- Session based authentication using transparent authentication against the underlying database.
- Efficient performance with scalable connection pooling and native asynchronous support.
