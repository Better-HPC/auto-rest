## Common Developer Tasks

Instructions are provided below for common tasks performed during development.
All commands are assumed to be run from within the root project directory.

### Environment Setup

Auto-REST uses the [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) utility to manage project dependencies.
To create a new project environment, point poetry at the desired Python interpreter.

```shell
poetry env use python3.14
```

Poetry will automatically build and activate the new environment.
To confirm the current environment, use the `list` command.

```shell
poetry env list
```

From within the activated environment, install the project dependencies.

```shell
poetry install
```

### Running Tests

All contributions are required to pass the application test suite.
To run the tests, start by installing the test dependencies:

```shell
poetry install --with tests
```

The `coverage` tool is used to track application test coverage and helps to maintain code quality by identifying untested areas.
To run tests with coverage, use the following commands:

```shell
coverage run -m unittest discover
coverage report
```

### Previewing Docs

To build and preview the documentation locally, start by installing the documentation dependencies:

```shell
poetry install --with docs
```

The `mkdocs` utility a static site generator that simplifies building and deploying project documentation. 
Running the following command will automatically compile the HTML documentation and launch it with a local server.

```shell
mkdocs serve
```
